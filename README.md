#  CSS Art – From Pikachu to Among Us Crewmate

This project is a pure **HTML & CSS artwork**, originally started with Pikachu, later improved to a more **realistic Among Us Crewmate** due to submission feedback in the **CSS Art Festival Challenge (800 pts)**.

No images, SVGs, or JavaScript — only HTML elements and CSS magic!
